# CredHub Patterns

This reference covers CredHub service instance naming conventions, credential JSON structures for each app type, and how credentials flow from CredHub to Spring Boot apps on Cloud Foundry.

## Overview

Sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords, AWS secrets) are stored in CredHub service instances on Cloud Foundry. They are bound to stream apps via SCDF deployer properties at deployment time. At runtime, each app reads its credentials from `VCAP_SERVICES`.

**Never pass secrets as:**
- Stream definition properties (`app.s3.aws.secret-key=...`)
- Environment variables in deployment properties
- Inline DSL parameters

**Always use CredHub service bindings.**

## Naming Convention

```
{pipeline-name}-{app-name}-creds
```

Examples:
- `legal-docs-rag-s3-creds`
- `legal-docs-rag-pgvector-sink-creds`
- `legal-docs-rag-embedding-creds`
- `events-monitor-jdbc-creds`

The `{app-name}` should match the SCDF app name used in the stream definition.

## Creating CredHub Service Instances

Use the **Cloud Foundry MCP server** to create service instances:

```
cf create-service credhub default {pipeline}-{app}-creds -c '{json_credentials}'
```

The `-c` flag accepts a JSON object where each key-value pair becomes a credential entry.

## Credential JSON Templates

### S3 Source/Sink (upstream)

```json
{
  "spring.cloud.aws.credentials.access-key": "AKIA...",
  "spring.cloud.aws.credentials.secret-key": "...",
  "spring.cloud.aws.region.static": "us-west-2"
}
```

These keys match Spring Cloud AWS auto-configuration properties. No bridging code needed.

### JDBC Source/Sink (upstream)

```json
{
  "spring.datasource.url": "jdbc:postgresql://host:5432/dbname",
  "spring.datasource.username": "myuser",
  "spring.datasource.password": "mypassword"
}
```

These keys match Spring Boot DataSource auto-configuration. No bridging code needed.

### MongoDB Source/Sink (upstream)

```json
{
  "spring.data.mongodb.uri": "mongodb://user:pass@host:27017/dbname"
}
```

### MQTT Source/Sink (upstream)

```json
{
  "mqtt.url": "tcp://broker:1883",
  "mqtt.username": "myuser",
  "mqtt.password": "mypassword"
}
```

### Mail Source (upstream)

```json
{
  "mail.imap.host": "imap.example.com",
  "mail.imap.username": "user@example.com",
  "mail.imap.password": "mypassword"
}
```

### FTP Source (upstream)

```json
{
  "ftp.host": "ftp.example.com",
  "ftp.username": "ftpuser",
  "ftp.password": "ftppassword"
}
```

### SFTP Source (upstream)

```json
{
  "sftp.host": "sftp.example.com",
  "sftp.username": "sftpuser",
  "sftp.password": "sftppassword"
}
```

### Elasticsearch Sink (upstream)

```json
{
  "spring.elasticsearch.uris": "https://es-host:9200",
  "spring.elasticsearch.username": "elastic",
  "spring.elasticsearch.password": "mypassword"
}
```

### Embedding Processor (custom RAG)

```json
{
  "EMBEDDING_API_KEY": "sk-..."
}
```

The `CredHubEmbeddingConfig` class bridges `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` to `spring.ai.openai.api-key` via `@PostConstruct`.

### PgVector Sink (custom RAG)

```json
{
  "PGVECTOR_URL": "jdbc:postgresql://host:5432/vectordb",
  "PGVECTOR_USERNAME": "pguser",
  "PGVECTOR_PASSWORD": "pgpassword",
  "EMBEDDING_API_KEY": "sk-..."
}
```

The `CredHubPgVectorConfig` class bridges these keys:
- `PGVECTOR_URL` → `spring.datasource.url`
- `PGVECTOR_USERNAME` → `spring.datasource.username`
- `PGVECTOR_PASSWORD` → `spring.datasource.password`
- `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` → `spring.ai.openai.api-key`

### Agent-Generated Custom Apps

For custom apps generated by the `custom-app-builder` subagent, the credential JSON structure depends on what the app needs. The subagent should:

1. Define `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` CredHub keys in the app's `CredHub*Config` class
2. Bridge them to Spring Boot properties via `@PostConstruct`
3. Document the required keys so the credential-provisioner subagent can create the service instance

## How Credentials Flow

### 1. CredHub Service Instance

Created via `cf create-service credhub default {name} -c '{json}'`. Cloud Foundry stores the JSON in CredHub's encrypted backend.

### 2. SCDF Deployer Property

At deployment time, the deployer property binds the service to the specific app:

```
deployer.{app}.cloudfoundry.services={pipeline}-{app}-creds
```

When SCDF deploys the stream app on CF, it includes this service binding in the app manifest.

### 3. VCAP_SERVICES at Runtime

Cloud Foundry injects the credentials into the app's environment as `VCAP_SERVICES`:

```json
{
  "credhub": [{
    "label": "credhub",
    "name": "legal-docs-rag-s3-creds",
    "credentials": {
      "spring.cloud.aws.credentials.access-key": "AKIA...",
      "spring.cloud.aws.credentials.secret-key": "...",
      "spring.cloud.aws.region.static": "us-west-2"
    }
  }]
}
```

### 4. Spring Boot Property Flattening

Spring Boot's Cloud Foundry connector flattens `VCAP_SERVICES` credentials into properties. Each key in the `credentials` object becomes a Spring Boot property.

**For upstream apps:** If the CredHub keys match the app's expected property names (e.g., `spring.datasource.url`), the app reads them automatically. No code changes needed.

**For custom apps with bridging:** The `CredHub*Config` classes use `@Value("${KEY:#{null}}")` to read the keys and `System.setProperty(...)` in `@PostConstruct` to bridge them to the properties the app consumes.

## Multiple Service Bindings

An app can be bound to multiple CredHub service instances. Separate names with commas:

```
deployer.pgvector-sink.cloudfoundry.services=my-pipeline-pgvector-creds,my-pipeline-extra-creds
```

Each service instance's credentials are merged into `VCAP_SERVICES`. If two service instances provide the same key, the behavior is undefined — avoid key collisions.

## Credential Lifecycle

### Update Credentials

```
cf update-service {pipeline}-{app}-creds -c '{"key":"new-value"}'
```

After updating, undeploy and redeploy the stream to pick up changes.

### Delete Credentials

```
cf delete-service {pipeline}-{app}-creds -f
```

The `-f` flag skips confirmation. Only delete after the stream is undeployed and destroyed.

### Verify Credentials Exist

```
cf services
```

Look for the service instance name in the output. Status should be `create succeeded`.
